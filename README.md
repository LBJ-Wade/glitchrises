# Rapid crust coupling and glitch rises in superfluid neutron stars

This repository will provide a Jupyter notebook and accompanying files to recreate the results and plots of Graber et al. (2018). Please cite Graber et al. (2018)
when using this material.

## Description

The Jupyter notebook contains code to integrate the TOV equations for a specific neutron star crust model and calculate the mutual friction coefficients as a
function of cylindrical radius and relative mass fraction. It subsequently allows numerical integration of a simple three-component neutron star toy model,
providing the time evolution of the angular velocities, to determine the shape of the glitch rise of a Vela-like pulsar.

The .txt file contains the microscopic parameters for the inner crust as given in Table 1 of Graber et al. (2018).

The remaining files are Figures 1-3 of Graber et al. (2018).
